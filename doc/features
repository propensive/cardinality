- introduces `Double`s which are constrained to a numeric range, checked at compile time
- intuitive `a ~ b` syntax for representing a ranged `Double`
- ordinary `Double` literals can be used in positions which expect a ranged type
- numeric ranges compose under arithmetic operations
- escape-hatch (called `force`) for unsafe but easy conversions
