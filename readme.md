# Cardinality

__Constraints for constraining sets of real numbers__

_Cardinality_ introduces numerically-constrained `Double` types which are as usable as ordinary `Double`s, but safely constrained to a range that
is specified in their type.

## Features

- introduces `Double`s which are constrained to a numeric range, checked at compile time
- intuitive `a ~ b` syntax for representing a ranged `Double`
- ordinary `Double` literals can be used in positions which expect a ranged type
- numeric ranges compose under arithmetic operations
- escape-hatch (called `force`) for unsafe but easy conversions


## Availability

Cardinality has not yet been published as a binary. It is currently waiting for the
final release of Scala 3.3.

## Getting Started

_Cardinality_ provides a representation of numbers which must lie within a certain (closed) range. A range type is written with the
infix `~` type operator, between two doubles, for example, `-1.0 ~ 1.0` represents a `Double` which is at least `-1.0` and at most
`1.0`.

Compiletime operations check `Double` literals for conformance to the claimed bounds, for example:
```scala
val x: 0.0 ~ 100.0 = 33.3 // good
val y: 0.0 ~ 1.0 = 2.0    // compile error
```

Standard arithmetic operations are also implemented on ranged `Double`s. Depending on whether the right-hand operand is a statically-unknown
`Double`, a `Double` singleton literal, or a ranged `Double`, the result will be typed as precisely as possible. For example, adding `10.0` to
an instance of `3.0 ~ 5.0` will produce a result of type, `13.0 ~ 15.0`. These operations use typelevel arithmetic to calculate the resultant
range of the calculation, and can be composed like other arithmetic functions, with the return type inferred. For example,
```scala
var x: 0.0 ~ 1.0 = 0.2
var y: -1.0 ~ 1.0 = 0.2
var z: 1e3 ~ 1e8 = 10000

val result = (x + y*3.0)*z
```
will infer the type of `result` to be `-2.0e8 ~ 3.0e8` (while its value will be `6000.0`.

### Forcing values

Unranged `Double`s are pervasive in Scala, so a `Double#force` extension method is provided which can be used (carefully) to convert a `Double`
to an expected ranged type.



## Status

Cardinality is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Cardinality is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 82 lines of code.

## Building

Cardinality can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Cardinality are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/cardinality/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Cardinality easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

The _cardinality_ of a set is the number of elements it contains, while _Cardinality_ controls the size of sets of `Double`s.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
